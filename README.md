## 🧠 What I'm Passionate About

### 🤖 **Agentic AI Systems**
Building autonomous AI agents that can reason, plan, and execute complex workflows. Currently exploring:
- **Multi-agent orchestration** with frameworks like LangGraph, CrewAI
- **Reasoning engines** for complex problem-solving
- **AI-powered workflow automation** (n8n, Temporal)
- **RAG systems** with advanced retrieval and contextual reasoning

### ☁️ **Cloud-Native Application Development**
Creating scalable, resilient applications using modern cloud patterns:
- **Serverless architectures** on AWS (Lambda, Step Functions, EventBridge)
- **Container orchestration** (Docker, Kubernetes, ECS)
- **Microservices** with event-driven design
- **Infrastructure as Code** (Terraform, CDK, CloudFormation)

### 📊 **Data Engineering & Analytics**
Leveraging Snowflake and modern data stacks for insights:
- **Snowflake data modeling** and optimization
- **Data pipeline orchestration** (dbt, Airflow, Prefect)
- **Real-time analytics** and streaming architectures
- **MLOps pipelines** for model training and deployment
