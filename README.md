## 🧠 My Thought Leadership and Vision

### 🤖 **Agentic AI Systems**
Building autonomous AI agents that can reason, plan, and execute complex workflows. Currently exploring:
- **AI-powered workflow automation** (n8n, Langflow)
- **RAG systems** with advanced retrieval and contextual reasoning

### ☁️ **Cloud-Native Application Development**
Creating scalable, resilient applications using modern cloud patterns:
- **Serverless architectures**  (Lambda and Azure Functions)
- **Container orchestration** (Docker, Kubernetes, ECS, ECR, GitHub Container Registry)
- **Microservices** (Kafka, MCP)
- **Infrastructure as Code** (Terraform, CDK, CloudFormation)

### 📊 **Data Engineering & Analytics**
Leveraging Snowflake and modern data stacks for insights:
- **Snowflake data modeling** (LakeHouse, Medallion Architectures)
- **Data pipeline orchestration** (Tasks, Streams, Procedures)
- **Real-time analytics** (Steamlit, Cortex Analyst, Cortex Search)
